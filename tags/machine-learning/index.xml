      <description>An overview of published and ongoing research papers within the machine learning for pricing research line developed in my lab. This research line puts focus on:data driven strategies to handle continuous and spatial risk factorssparse regression with automatic feature selection and binningtree-based machine learning techniques for pricing.Watch Roel Henckaerts presenting our paper on tree-based machine learning during UseR!2018 in Brisbane.
Boosting insights in insurance tariff plans with tree-basedmachine learning methods Collaborators: Roel Henckaerts, Katrien Antonio, Marie-Pier Côté and Roel Verbelen.</description>
