#### KU Leuven, Belgium
##### Faculty of Economics and Business

<p align="justify">I am professor in actuarial science and insurance analytics at <a href="https://kuleuven.be/eng"target="_blank">KU Leuven</a>, <a href="https://feb.kuleuven.be/eng"target="_blank">Faculty of Economics and Business</a>, <a href="https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/accounting-finance-insurance/accounting-finance-insurance"target="_blank">Research Group Accounting, Finance and Insurance</a>.</p>

At KU Leuven I coordinate and teach the courses:

><p align="justify"><a href="https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/D0R33AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp648112" target="_blank">Loss Models</a>. This is a 6 ects course that equips students with the basic tools necessary for the construction, estimation and interpretation of quantitative risk models, with a particular focus on the frequency - severity approach typical for general insurance loss models. The course explains probabilistic concepts relevant for frequency and severity modeling, explains how to use these building blocks to set up loss models, how to calibrate the models on data and how to measure risks using such models.</p>

><p align="justify"><a href="https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/D0N55AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp1639040" target="_blank">Data science for general insurance</a>. This is a 6 ects course that equips students with a wide range of methods from data science useful for pricing and reserving in non-life insurance. Starting from GLMs and GAMs, we next cover regularization methods and tree-based techniques (including random forests, bagging, boosting) for both regression and classification. Computer labs in R demonstrate the techniques with practical use cases.</p>

><p align="justify"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonas-crevecoeur-5a6b87136/?originalSubdomain=be" target="_blank">Advanced Life Insurance Mathematics</a>. This is a 6 ects course that equips students with quantitative and statistical skills relevant for a selection of advanced topics in the life insurance business. The course covers stochastic mortality projection models and multi-state models. Computer labs in R demonstrate the techniques with practical use cases.</p>

><p align="justify"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonas-crevecoeur-5a6b87136/?originalSubdomain=be" target="_blank">MSc thesis in Actuarial and Financial Engineering</a>. This is a 15 ects course in which the student demonstrates his ability to analyse complex problems independently and at an academic level. The focus of the masterâ€™s thesis is on scientific research and related practice in the domains of actuarial science, finance and related domains. I am the coordinator of the MSc thesis in actuarial and financial engineering.</p>

#### University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands
##### Faculty of Economics and Business

<p align="justify">I am part-time associate professor in actuarial science and insurance analytics at <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en"target="_blank">UvA</a>, <a href="http://www.uva.nl/en/faculties/faculteit-economie-en-bedrijfskunde/feb-landing-page.html"target="_blank">Faculty of Economics and Business</a>, <a href="http://ase.uva.nl/research/institute.html"target="_blank">Amsterdam School of Economics</a>, research group Actuarial Science and Mathematical Finance.</p>

At UvA I coordinate and teach the course:

><p align="justify"><a href="http://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2018-2019-en/search-course/course/59016" target="_blank">Life Insurance Mathematics</a>. This is a 6 ects course that equips students with insights in human mortality models and human mortality data, and a
general framework for the valuation of life contingent liabilities where cash flows depend on the future lifetime of one insured or multiple insureds. 
The course covers the calculation of actuarial present values, premium structures and policy values for different types of life annuity and life insurance products, both in discrete and continuous time for one and multiple insureds.</p>

##### Amsterdam Business School

<p align="justify">I develop, teach and coordinate modules in the Executive Program in actuarial science at the Amsterdam Business School, in the Actuarial Practice Cycle. More specifically, I co-teach the module on *Product Development: the case of disability insurance* with Niels Van der Laan (Milliman) and Pieter Bultena (PwC) and the module on *Insurance Analytics: an actuarial perspective on data science* with dr. Bram Wouters (UvA).</p>
