The <a href="https://feb.kuleuven.be/eng/prospective-students/master-of-actuarial-and-financial-engineering"target="_blank">MSc of Actuarial and Financial Engineering</a> is an English taught MSc program of 120 ects, offered jointly by the Faculty of Economics and Business and the Faculty of Science at KU Leuven. The program prepares students for careers in actuarial science, financial engineering or quantitative risk management within financial institutions. I serve as the program director of this MSc program, since academic year 2018-2019.</p>

<p align="justify">
The MAFE courses are also available as <u class="dotted">electives</u> in other KU Leuven programmes (MSc in Mathematics, Statistics, Mathematical Engineering, Business Engineering, Physics). If you are currently in one of these programmes, choosing the MAFE courses as electives in your current study program enables a smooth transition to the Master in Actuarial and Financial Engineering. Your gateway for a career as actuary or risk manager!
