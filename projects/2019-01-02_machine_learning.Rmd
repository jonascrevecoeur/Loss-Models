<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> We present a **fully data driven strategy to incorporate continuous risk factors and geographical information in an insurance tariff**. A framework is developed that aligns flexibility with the practical requirements of an insurance company, the policyholder and the regulator. Our strategy is illustrated with an example from property and casualty (P&C) insurance, namely a motor insurance case study. We start by fitting generalized additive models (GAMs) to the number of reported claims and their corresponding severity. These models allow for flexible statistical modeling in the presence of different types of risk factors: categorical, continuous, and spatial risk factors. The goal is **to bin the continuous and spatial risk factors such that categorical risk factors result which captures the effect of the covariate on the response in an accurate way, while being easy to use in a generalized linear model (GLM)**. This is in line with the requirement of an insurance company to construct a practical and interpretable tariff that can be explained easily to stakeholders. We propose to bin the spatial risk factor using Fisher’s natural breaks algorithm and the continuous risk factors using evolutionary trees. GLMs are fitted to the claims data with the resulting categorical risk factors. We find that the resulting GLMs approximate the original GAMs closely, and lead to a very similar premium structure.

<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> In this paper we apply machine learning techniques to insurance pricing, thereby leaving the comfort zone of both traditional rate making and machine learning. The insurance industry typically stays within the framework of generalized linear models (GLMs), while our
study focuses on **machine learning to develop full tariff plans built from both the frequency
and severity of claims**. Traditional regression problems in machine learning involve a mean
squared error loss function. We adapt the cost functions and performance measures used
in the algorithms such that the specific characteristics of insurance data are carefully incorporated:
highly unbalanced count data with excess zeros and varying exposure on the
frequency side and scarce, but potentially heavy-tailed data on the severity side. One of
our key requirements is the need for transparent and interpretable pricing models which are
easily explainable to all stakeholders. We therefore focus on machine learning with decision
trees: **starting from simple regression trees we work towards more advanced ensembles such
as random forests and boosted trees**. We show how to choose the optimal tuning parameters
for these models in an elaborate cross-validation scheme. We also present visualization tools
to obtain insights from the resulting models by assessing the importance of different risk
factors and their impact on the price of an insurance contract. The economic value of these
new modeling approaches is evaluated with loss ratios, double lift charts, ordered Lorenz
curves and Gini indices. These tools allow the insurer to form profitable portfolios and to
guard against potential adverse selection risks.
