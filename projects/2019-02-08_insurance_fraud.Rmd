<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> Fraud occurs in the insurance industry, for example, when policyholders file exaggerated or
fictitious claims. Such fraudulent cases are often the result of organized schemes carried out
by committed groups of collaborators. We strive to detect such groups of fraudsters by **linking
together claims and the involved parties in a massive social network**. As such, we are able to
look beyond the classical properties of the claim, the policyholder and the policy, and study
the social structures of fraudsters in insurance fraud detection tools and models. In a first
attempt of using social network analysis for fraud detection in insurance, the approach was
static with small subnetworks. In our study, we leverage the entire network of claims and
policyholders of an insurance company and apply **a fraud propagation algorithm, based on
personalized PageRank**. Thereby, we obtain scores that quantify the claims' exposure to
fraud, relative to known fraudulent claims. These scores are then combined with intrinsic
features in an **analytical fraud detection model to flag highly suspicions claims for further
investigation**. This approach was developed for social security fraud and deals with the time
evolving nature of fraud, by weighting relationships in time, as well as the typical high class
imbalance in fraud datasets. We illustrate this application using a real life dataset.
