<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> It is well known that many factors influence the level of individual mortality rates.
The increasing sophistication of modern statistical methods and the availability of
data on the level of individuals allow us to identify the most powerful explanatory
variables. We present a statistical framework based on 
flexible Poisson regressions
that exploits the detailed **micro-level lifetime data** available on individual participants
in large datasets, which may include categorical, continuous and spatial risk factors.
We select the most important covariates with statistical criteria measuring the in- and
out-of-sample performance of the Poisson regression models for death counts.
We apply our approach to **a huge dataset from a Dutch pension fund**. Available
candidates to explain mortality differences in the fund include **the age, the salary, the
time spent in disability, the level of education of participants and the municipalities
or neighborhoods where they reside**. For this portfolio, the most relevant risk factors
(next to age and gender) are the salary, the time spent in disability and an allowance
for working at irregular hours. When analyzing personalized mortality risk profiles
based on these risk factors, we find substantial differences between the remaining life
expectancies for the most-favorable and least-favorable risk profiles in the fund (the
`longevity-gap'): about 12 years at age 25 and 10 years at age 65.

<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> Insurance companies and pension funds must value liabilities using **mortality rates that are appropriate for their portfolio**. These can only be estimated in a reliable way from a sufficiently large historical dataset for such portfolios, which is often not available. We overcome this problem by introducing a model to **estimate portfolio-specific mortality simultaneously with population mortality**. By using a **Bayesian** framework, we automatically generate the appropriate weighting for the limited statistical information in a given portfolio and the more extensive information that is available for the whole population. This allows us to separate parameter uncertainty from uncertainty due to the randomness in individual deaths for a given realization of mortality rates. When we apply our method to a dataset of assured lives in England and Wales, we find that different prior specifications for the portfolio-specific factors lead to significantly different posterior distributions for hazard rates. However, in short-term predictive distributions for future numbers of deaths, individual mortality risk turns out to be more important than parameter uncertainty in the portfolio-specific factors, both for large and for small portfolios.

</br> </br>
<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> The quantification of longevity risk in a systematic way requires statistically sound forecasts of mortality rates and their corresponding uncertainty. Actuarial associations have a long history and continue to play an important role in the development, application and dispersion of mortality projections for the countries they represent. This paper gives an **in depth presentation and discussion of the mortality projections as published by the Dutch (in 2014) and Belgian (in 2015) actuarial associations**. The goal of these institutions was to publish a stochastic mortality projection model in line with both rigorous standards of state-of-the-art academic work as well as the requirements of practical work such as robustness and transparency. Constructed by a team of authors from both academia and practice, the developed mortality projection standard is a Li and Lee type multi-population model. To project mortality, a global Western European trend and a country-specific deviation from this trend are jointly modelled with a bivariate time series model. We motivate and document all choices made in the model specification, calibration and forecasting process as well as the model selection strategy. We show the model fit and mortality projections and illustrate the use of the model in several pension-related applications.

</br> </br>
<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> Most mortality models proposed in recent literature rely on the standard ARIMA framework (in particular: a random walk with drift) to project mortality rates. As a result the projections are **highly sensitive to the calibration period**. We therefore analyse the impact of allowing for **multiple structural changes** on a large collection of mortality models. We find that this may lead to more robust projections for the period effect but that there is only a limited effect on the ranking of the models based on backtesting criteria, since there is often not yet sufficient statistical evidence for structural changes. However, there are cases for which we do find improvements in estimates and we therefore conclude that one should not exclude on beforehand that structural changes may have occurred.

</br> </br>
<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> Life insurers, pension funds, health care providers and social security institutions face increasing expenses due to continuing improvements of mortality rates. The actuarial and demographic literature has introduced a myriad of (deterministic and stochastic) models to forecast mortality rates of single populations. This paper presents **a Bayesian analysis of two related multi-population mortality models of log-bilinear type, designed for two or more populations**. Using a larger set of data, multi-population mortality models allow joint modelling and projection of mortality rates by identifying characteristics shared by all sub-populations as well as sub-population specific effects on mortality. This is important when modeling and forecasting mortality of males and females, regions within a country and when dealing with index-based longevity hedges. Our first model is inspired by the two factor Lee–Carter model of Renshaw and Haberman (Insur Math Eco 33(2):255–272, 2003) and the common factor model of Carter and Lee (Int J forecast 8:393–411, 1992. The second model is the augmented common factor model of Li and Lee (Demography 42(3):575–594, 2005). This paper approaches both models in a statistical way, using a Poisson distribution for the number of deaths at a certain age and in a certain time period. Moreover, we use Bayesian statistics to calibrate the models and to produce mortality forecasts. We develop the technicalities necessary for Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations and provide software implementation for the models discussed in the paper. Key benefits of this approach are multiple. We jointly calibrate the Poisson likelihood for the number of deaths and the times series models imposed on the time dependent parameters, we enable full allowance for parameter uncertainty and we are able to handle missing data as well as small sample populations. We compare and contrast results from both models to the results obtained with a frequentist single population approach and a least squares estimation of the augmented common factor model.
