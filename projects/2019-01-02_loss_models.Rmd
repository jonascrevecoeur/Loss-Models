<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> In risk analysis, a **global fit** that appropriately captures the body and the tail of the distribution of losses is essential. Modelling the whole range of the losses using a standard distribution is usually very hard and often impossible due to the specific characteristics of the body and the tail of the loss distribution. A possible solution is to **combine two distributions in a splicing model**: a **light-tailed** distribution for the body which covers light and moderate losses, and a **heavy-tailed** distribution for the tail to capture large losses. We propose a **splicing model with a mixed Erlang (ME) distribution for the body and a Pareto distribution for the tail**. This combines the flexibility of the ME distribution with the ability of the Pareto distribution to model extreme values. We extend our splicing approach for censored and/or truncated data. Relevant examples of such data can be found in financial risk analysis. We illustrate the flexibility of this splicing model using practical examples from risk measurement.

<u class="dotted">Journal paper:</u> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10985-015-9343-y"target="_blank">Lifetime Data Analysis, 22(3), 429-455, 2016.</a>

</br> </br>
<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> Multivariate mixtures of Erlang distributions form a versatile, yet analytically tractable, class of distributions making them suitable for **multivariate density estimation**. We present a flexible and effective fitting procedure for multivariate mixtures of Erlangs, which iteratively uses the **EM algorithm**, by introducing a computationally efficient initialization and adjustment strategy for the shape parameter vectors. We furthermore extend the EM algorithm for multivariate mixtures of Erlangs to be able to deal with **randomly censored and fixed truncated data**. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on simulated as well as real data sets.
