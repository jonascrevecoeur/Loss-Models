<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> Holding sufficient capital is essential for an insurance company to ensure its solvability. Hence,
predicting the amount of capital needed to fulfill future liabilities in an accurate way is an im-
portant actuarial task. Insurers record detailed information related to claims (e.g. cause of the
claim) and policies (e.g. value of the insured risk) for pricing insurance contracts. However,
this same information is largely neglected when estimating the reserve. We present a 
flexible
framework for including these claim specific covariates. Our framework focuses on three build-
ing blocks in the development process: the time to settlement, the number of payments and
the size of each payment. We present a well-chosen generalized linear model (GLM) for each
of these stochastic building blocks. Standard model selection techniques for GLMs allows us
to determine the appropriate covariates in these models. We demonstrate how these covari-
ates determine the granularity of our reserving model. On the one extreme, including many
covariates leads to large differences in the development process of individual claims. On the
other extreme, including no covariates, corresponds to specifying a model for data aggregated
in a triangle. The set of selected covariates then naturally determines the position the actuary
should take in between those two extremes. Moreover, since similar generalized linear models
are applied in the pricing of insurance contracts, our project bridges the gap between pricing and
reserving methodology. We illustrate our method on a case study of a real life insurance dataset.

<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> This paper considers the problem of predicting the number of events that have occurred in the past, but which are not yet observed due to a delay. Such delayed events are relevant
in predicting the future cost of warranties, pricing maintenance contracts, determining
the number of unreported claims in insurance and in modeling the outbreak of diseases.
Disregarding these unobserved events results in a systematic underestimation of the event
occurrence process. Our approach puts emphasis on modeling the time between the occurrence
and observation of the event, the so-called observation delay. We propose a granular
model for the heterogeneity in this observation delay based on the occurrence day of the
event and on calendar day effects in the observation process, such as weekday and holiday
effects. We illustrate this approach on a European general liability insurance data set where
the occurrence of an accident is reported to the insurer with delay.

Insurance companies need to hold capital to be able to fulfill future liabilities with respect to
the policies they write. Due to the delay in the reporting of claims, not all of the claims that
occurred in the past have been observed yet. The accurate estimation of the number of incurred
but not reported claims forms an essential part of claims reserving. We present a 
exible framework
to jointly estimate the occurrence and reporting of claims from granular data at daily
level. A regression approach includes the seasonal effects and incorporates the proportional
effect of exposure on claim occurrences. By regarding the daily run-off triangle of claims as an
incomplete data problem, estimation is performed by the EM algorithm. The resulting method
is elegant, easy to understand and implement, and provides refined forecasts on a daily level.
The proposed methodology is applied to a European general liability portfolio. Initial insight
into the data set motivates us to model the reporting delay in weeks combined with day-specific
reporting probabilities. The performance of our model is evaluated based on out-of-sample data.
