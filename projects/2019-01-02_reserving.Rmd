<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> Insurers record detailed information related to claims (e.g. the cause of the claim) and policies (e.g. the value of the insured risk) for pricing insurance contracts. However, this information is largely neglected when estimating the reserve for future liabilities originating from past exposures. We present **a flexible, yet highly interpretable framework for including these claim and policy-specific covariates in a reserving model**. Our framework focuses on three building blocks in the development process of a claim: the time to settlement, the number of payments and the size of each payment. We carefully choose **a generalized linear model (GLM) to model each of these stochastic building blocks in discrete time**. Since GLMs are applied in the pricing of insurance contracts, our project bridges the gap between pricing and reserving methodology. We propose model selection techniques for GLMs adapted for censored data to select the relevant covariates in these models and demonstrate how the selected covariates determine the granularity of our reserving model. At one extreme, including many covariates captures the heterogeneity in the development process of individual claims, while at the other extreme, including no covariates corresponds to specifying a model for data aggregated in two-dimensional contingency tables, similar to the run-off triangles traditionally used by reserving actuaries. **The set of selected covariates then naturally determines the position the actuary should take in between those two extremes.** We illustrate our method with case studies on real life insurance data sets. These case studies provide new insights in the covariates driving the development of claims and demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the reserving methodology over time.

<u class="dotted">Abstract.</u> This paper considers the problem of **predicting the number of events that have occurred in the past, but which are not yet observed due to a delay**. Such delayed events are relevant
in predicting the future cost of warranties, pricing maintenance contracts, determining
the number of unreported claims in insurance and in modeling the outbreak of diseases.
Disregarding these unobserved events results in a systematic underestimation of the event
occurrence process. Our approach puts emphasis on modeling the time between the occurrence
and observation of the event, the so-called observation delay. We propose **a granular
model for the heterogeneity in this observation delay based on the occurrence day of the
event and on calendar day effects in the observation process**, such as weekday and holiday
effects. We illustrate this approach on a European general liability insurance data set where
the occurrence of an accident is reported to the insurer with delay.

A delay between the occurrence and the reporting of events often has practical implications such as for the amount of capital to hold for insurance companies, or for taking preventive actions in case of infectious diseases. **The accurate estimation of the number of incurred but not (yet) reported events forms an essential part of properly dealing with this phenomenon.** We **review** the current practice for analysing such data and we present **a flexible regression framework to jointly estimate the occurrence and reporting of events from data at daily level**. By linking this setting to an incomplete data problem, estimation is performed by the **expectation-maximization algorithm**. The resulting method is elegant, easy to understand and implement, and provides refined forecasts on a daily level. The proposed methodology is applied to a European general liability portfolio in insurance.
